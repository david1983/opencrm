## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** v7 or higher — [Install](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) (free tier available)
- **npm** v9+ (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/david1983/opencrm.git
   cd opencrm
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs dependencies for both the client and server workspaces.

3. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   cp client/.env.example client/.env
   ```

   Edit `server/.env` with your settings:

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/opencrm
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key
   JWT_EXPIRE=7d

   # OAuth (optional)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Seed the database** (optional — adds sample data)

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This launches both the frontend and backend concurrently:
   - 🌐 **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - ⚙️ **Backend API**: [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api)

docker build -t opencrm .
docker run -p 5000:5000 opencrm
```

The `docker-compose.yml` includes MongoDB, so you can get a complete stack running with a single command.
